# ** BREAST-CANCER **
Breast Cancer is becoming a leading cause of death among women in the whole world; meanwhile, it is confirmed that the early detection and accurate diagnosis of this disease can ensure a long survival of the patients. Breast cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases of world, in the last decade; more than 1.5 million new cases are diagnosed each year, with more than 400 thousands deaths.The use of Big Data techniques in the past years has got and created an impact to the implementation of solutions hence simplifying and changing the flow of systems in real life expectations. Especially in medical field, where those methods are widely used in diagnosis and analysis to make decisions. The main objective of this analysis is to diagnose patients with breast cancer at an early stage by analyzing the data of the patients and classify them into 2 categories, having diagnosis results as Benign (B) and Malignant (M). We analyse the breast Cancer data available from the Wisconsin dataset from UCI machine learning with the aim of developing accurate prediction models for breast cancer using big data techniques. In this proposal, we used the Extreme Gradient Boosting technique (XGBoost). The model evaluation/validation metrics used were: Precision, Accuracy, Recall, Specificity percentages. Our model (XGBoost) Extreme Gradient Boost had a an accuracy of 96.93%, with a recall of 1.00%, a precision of 95.48% and a specificity of 91.25%.
